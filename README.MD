#The Literate ASseMbler
### an odd but simple ~~compiler~~ assembler

The Literate ASseMbler is a product of both my newfound love of Ruby and anger towards C compiler issues, and as a result has an index generated by a separate script to aid navigation of it's icky source. Being a "language" made to construct operating systems,  there are not many flashy things that really any other programming language has, and it's barely a tier above raw assembly.

# In Development Features

* Math instructions
* More efficient code generation
* Source file comments and documentation
* Standard Ruby formatting

# Maybe Upcoming Features

* A working language
* A better wiki

# Things You Can Do

While you really can commit anything, I would greatly appreciate you doing the following:
* Coming up with marker and instruction ideas
* Error testing LASM to the fullest extent (making sure all errors make sense and are related)
* Making sure I (and really anyone else) follow the [Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
